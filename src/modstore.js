        "The New Believers module is made up of eight essential lessons. Each lesson is designed to give you a better understanding of your new life with Christ and your responsibility as a believer in bringing glory to God. The first three lessons focus on the Gospel, Believerâ€™s Testimony, and Assurance of Salvation. These lessons are designed to help you better understand the Good News about Jesus, how it has personally affected your life, and how it will continuously transform you each day. The fourth lesson is on Baptism which is one of the first steps of obedience for every new believer. The last four lessons focus on the four disciplines a believer should be walking in daily: Evangelism, Bible, Prayer, and Fellowship.",
