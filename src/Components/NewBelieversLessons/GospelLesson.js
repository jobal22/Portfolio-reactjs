                The Gospel is very important. It functions as the answer to our
                sin problem. Through it, God offers salvation for anyone who
                believes.

            <p className="lsisti">
              The Gospel is the Good News of Jesus Christ. Jesus died on the
              cross for the sins of the world. After three days, He rose from
              the grave. The Gospel demonstrates our sin problem, provides a
              solution for us, and invites us to take part in a relationship
              with God. The Apostle Paul wrote that the Gospel is the power of
              God for salvation to everyone who believes (Romans 1:16). He says
              the Gospel is something to be shared, heard, and believed upon
              (Romans 10:14-15). Every person should get a chance to hear the
              Gospel (Matthew 28:18-20). Every follower of Jesus should be
              sharing the Gospel (Acts 1:8).

            <h2 className="lsist">Gospel Explanation</h2>
            <h3>The Problem</h3>
            <p className="lsisti">
              Sin is disobedience to God’s commands (Gen 3:17; Romans 5:12). An
              example of God’s commands can be found in Exodus 20. These are the
              10 commandments (insert them). Jesus summarizes all of God’s
              commandments under two categories: loving God and loving others
              (Matt 22:34-40). The Bible says that everyone has sinned against
              God. Due to our disobedience, we are separated from God (Romans
              6:23). This separation means that we do not know Him, and we do
              not have peace with Him (Ephesians 2:11:16). Our works cannot save
              us (Eph 2:8-9) because they are like filthy rags to God (Is 64:2).{" "}
            </p>
            <p className="lsisti">
              God knows about our sin problem. He knows more about us than we
              know about ourselves (Psalms 139:1-6). He knows that all people
              disobey Him (Romans 3:23) and cannot save themselves (Matthew
              19:26). For God to save us, our status before Him would have to
              change from wicked to righteous, the penalty for our sins would
              have to be paid, and God’s law must be satisfied. When all three
              of these requirements are met, God declares us to be innocent
              before Him because of His righteousness (Romans 3:23-26).{" "}
            </p>
            <h3>The Solution</h3>
            <p className="lsisti">
              God’s solution to our sin problem has always been Jesus. Jesus is
              the only one able to meet all these requirements. Jesus is both
              God and man. Since He is 100% man, He grew tired (John 4:6),
              hungry (Mark 11:12), and was able to die (Romans 8:34). He was
              tempted (Hebrews 4:15), but He never sinned (2 Corinthians 5:21).
              He died for our sins on the cross (1 Corinthians 15:3).{" "}
            </p>
            <p className="lsisti">
              Jesus is also 100% God (Philippians 2:5-6). Before anything was
              created, Jesus existed (John 1:1-2). Before He was born as a man,
              He was with God the Father (John 17:5). God the Father and God the
              Son are one (John 10:30). This is one of the reasons why the
              religious leaders of His time wanted to kill Him (John 10:33).
              When Jesus died on the cross, death did not conqueror Him. Jesus
              defeated death (2 Timothy 1:10). Jesus rose from the grave on the
              third day (1 Corinthians 15:4).
            </p>
            <p className="lsisti">
              When Jesus died on the cross for our sins, it was to change our
              status before God from wicked to righteous. Christ’s death paid
              the penalty for our sin. Jesus’ death and resurrection satisfied
              God’s law. Jesus met all three requirements for God to see us as
              innocent before Him because of His righteousness (Romans 3:23-26).
            </p>
            <h3>The Invitation</h3>
            <p className="lsisti">
              God presents a beautiful invitation for a forever relationship
              with Him. The gift of eternal life is not earned but received
              (Romans 6:23; Ephesians 2:8-9). Our works cannot save us. Only the
              work of Jesus’ death, burial, and resurrection can save us. The
              Gospel invitation is to repent, believe, and call upon Jesus as
              Lord. Jesus calls for everyone to repent and believe (Mark 1:15).
              Apart from Christ, all people are dead in sin (Ephesians 2:1) and
              destined for hell (1 Corinthians 6:9). The Gospel gives an
              invitation to turn from trusting in the world, the devil, and the
              flesh (Acts 14:15; Ephesians 2:1-3) and to turn to trusting in
              Jesus (Acts 26:20; 1 Thessalonians 1:9). As we put our faith in
              Jesus as Savior, we are to confess Him as our Lord (Romans
              10:9-10, 13).{" "}
            </p>
            <p className="lsisti">
              When we turn from not trusting in Jesus and turn to faith in
              Jesus, God saves us by His grace (Ephesians 2:8). He demonstrates
              His righteousness by changing our status before Him from wicked to
              righteous (Romans 3:24). He sees our sin debt as completely and
              forever paid (Romans 3:24). His law is satisfied (Romans 3:25), we
              are declared children (John 1:12), servants (John 13:16), and
              friends of God (John 15:15).{" "}

            <h2 className="lsist">Examining the Heart</h2>
            <p className="lsisti">
              Have you received God’s free gift of salvation? Often, people
              confuse receive this gift of salvation in four ways.
            </p>
            <p className="lsisti s4s">
              1. Many people believe they are saved because they were born into
              a Christian family. It is a wonderful blessing to grow up in a
              home where the parent(s) are believers and build their home on the
              word of God. However, this does not provide salvation for you. The
              Christian home can/should provide many opportunities for you to
              hear the Gospel and trust in Jesus. But we are not saved because
              the people around us or over us are.
            </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p className="lsisti s4s">
              2. Attending Church is another activity the many people will trust
              gives them salvation. Church is the gathering of believers to
              worship God and serve one another. Attending Church doesn’t
              confirm salvation for any individual. However, a biblical Church
              provides opportunities for the Gospel to be heard so that you can
              place your faith in Jesus as Lord and Savior.
            </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p className="lsisti s4s">
              3. Often, people place their assurance of salvation in their
              baptism. Baptism is a public profession of your faith in Jesus as
              the Son of God. It is symbolic for the day that you repented of
              your sins and trust in Jesus. This means that infant baptism or
              ritual baptism doesn’t save you. In the Baptism lesson, we will
              discuss biblical baptism, which takes place after your place your
              faith in Jesus.
            </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p className="lsisti s4s">
              4. Another unfortunate confusion many have about salvation is that
              their works or good deeds saves them. The Bible thoroughly
              explains the fact that our deeds have done nothing for us in the
              context of salvation but separate us from God. Good deeds are not
              worth placing your faith in.
            </p>
            <hr></hr>
            <p className="lsisti">
              The Apostle John wrote, John 1:11-13 receiving Jesus by faith. We
              receive Jesus by faith when we repent of our sins and place our
              trust in Jesus as Lord and Savior. To “repent” means to change
              your mind or turn away from. When we repent of sin, we are
              withdrawing our faith from whatever is not Jesus. To “believe”
              mean to place your home or turn towards. When we believe in Jesus,
              we are placing our faith in only Him as Savior (the one who died
              on the cross and rose from the grave) and as Lord (the one who
              reigns over all things forever). We surrender all of ourselves to
              Him (1 Thessalonians 1:9).{" "}
            </p>
            <p className="lsisti">
              A great way to receive the gift of salvation is through prayer.
              There is no better way to start a relationship with God than by
              talking to Him. There are many word-by-word prayers to prayer
              called “A Prayer of Salvation.” But I encourage you to speak to
              God about these three things: 1) Your sin – confess your sins to
              God. Now that you realize that these actions were against God and
              the very reason Jesus died on the cross, talk to God about your
              sins and ask for forgiveness (1 John 1:9). 2) Your faith – talk to
              Jesus about believe in Him that He died on the cross and rose from
              the grave after three days (Romans 10:9). 3) Your confession –
              call out to Him as Lord. There is no one like Him, the Forever
              King (Romans 10:10).
            </p>
            <p className="lsisti">
              If you have repented, believed, and confessed Jesus as Lord and
              Savior then you are saved. You have the free gift of a forever
              relationship with God and your sins (all of them) are forgiven.
            </p>
            <p className="lsisti">
              If you have not repented, believed, and confessed Jesus as Lord
              and Savior then according to scripture you are not saved. But
              today can be the day that you are. What is keeping you from
              trusting Jesus? I encourage you to examine the importance of that
              issue against the importance life with Jesus. Bring this concern
              to God through prayer and to your pastor or small-group/Sunday
              School leader.
