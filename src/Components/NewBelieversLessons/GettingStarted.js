                Each lesson is designed to give you a better understanding of
                your new life with Christ and your responsibility as a believer
                in bringing glory to God.{" "}

                are designed to help you better understand the Good News about
                Jesus, how it has personally affected your life, and how it will
                continuously transform you each day.{" "}
