            <h2 className="lsist">What is a testimony and purpose?</h2>
            <p className="lsisti">
              A Testimony is a way in which we can communicate/witness to God’s
              saving power specifically in our lives. Your testimony will
              communicate the Gospel (Matthew 24:14), tell your salvation story (John
              4:39), and focus on God’s greatness (Acts 4:33). God can use our
              testimony to demonstrate to other believers about our salvation
              (Galatians 1:22-24). He can also use our testimony to allow unbelievers
              to hear the Gospel (Acts 26:12-29).

            <h2 className="lsist">Major Parts of a Testimony</h2>
            <p className="lsisti">
              There are at least three major parts to a believer’s testimony: 1.
              Your life before salvation, 2. How you got saved, and 3. Your life
              with Christ. A testimony functions the best when it contains
              scripture. Our tendency is to focus more on part I of our
              testimony to highlight how bad we were. However, the most
              important section of your testimony is part II. This is the most
              important because it will contain the Gospel. The Gospel is what
              the world needs to hear. You will spend the most time
              communicating this section so that your listener(s) are able to
              respond to the Gospel message.
            </p>
            <p className="lsisti">
              Let’s look at the three parts of a believer’s testimony while
              utilizing Ephesians 2:1-10.

              As we discussed in the Gospel Lesson, every person has sinned
              except Jesus. As the Apostle Paul details his testimony in Acts
              22:1-22, Acts 26:12-29, and Galatians 1:11-22; 2:1-10, he speak of
              his life as a unbeliever. This details his sins and need for
              Jesus’ salvation.{" "}
            </p>
            <p className="lsisti s4s">
              In Ephesians 2:1-10, Paul provides a template for the testimony of
              believers. The first three verses detail someone’s life before
              salvation. These verses provide a description, the direction, and
              the destination for unbelievers. The Bible describes a lost person
              as dead (Ephesians 2:1). Physically we will all die, but the unbeliever
              is spiritual dead, separated from God. The direction of the
              unbeliever has to do with the authority they are under and their
              behavior. The unbeliever lives under the authority of the world,
              the devil, and the flesh and behaves within the sinful desires of
              their own will (Ephesians 2:1-3). The wrath of God functions as the
              destination for unbelievers (Ephesians 2:3). Paul says that those who do
              not know God and do not obey the gospel of Jesus “will suffer the
              punishment of eternal destruction, away from the presence of the
              Lord and from the glory of his might (2 Thessalonians 1:9).{" "}

            <p className="lsisti s4s">
              Jesus is the only solution to the problem of sin. As discussed in
              the Gospel lesson, the only way that sin can be forgiven is at the
              price of a life (Hebrews 9:22). In the Old Testament, Israel was
              able to use animals as a sacrifice for their sins. The animals in
              the Old Testament remained dead, and every time Israel sinned,
              they would sacrifice a new animals (Hebrews 10:3-4). However,
              Jesus came and died on the cross as the ultimate sacrifice for the
              sins of the world. Then, He rose from the grave after three days.
              He died for all of our sins once and for all (Hebrews 10:10). He
              will never die again, and we do not need any other sacrifice for
              the forgiveness of sin (Romans 6:9-10). He paid the full cost
              (John 19:30).
            </p>
            <p className="lsisti s4s">
              In Ephesians 2:4-9, the Bible demonstrates God’s great love in
              salvation. These verses provide a description of God (Ephesians
              2:4), tell of His love poured out (Ephesians 2:5-7), and His love
              at work (Ephesians 2:8-9).{" "}
            </p>
            <p className="lsisti s4s">
              God is described as rich in mercy and this is because of His great
              love (Ephesians 2:4). God doesn’t desire sacrifice. He actually desires
              mercy because He is a merciful God (Matthew 9:13). This means that
              God does not give us what we deserve. We deserve death and
              separation (Romans 3:23; 6:23). However, when Jesus came to the
              earth, He did not come for the righteous, but for the sinners
              (Matthew 9:13). He did not come to condemn but to save (John
              3:17). His mercy comes from His great love (Romans 5:8).
            </p>
            <p className="lsisti s4s">
              God poured this love out on us through His Son. He didn’t call us
              to fix our own sin problem and then come to Him. Instead, He came
              to us to fix our sin problem (John 3:16; Romans 5:8). Jesus died
              on the cross for our sins and rose from the grave so that we could
              have a forever relationship with God (Romans 4:24). Through Jesus,
              He demonstrated His grace. This means that God gave us what we did
              not deserve. We do not deserve our sins to be forever removed nor
              a forever relationship with God. However, through Jesus' death and
              resurrection, God made us alive, raised, and seated with Him
              (Ephesians 2:5-6). In all of this, God is showing His kindness to
              us and the world (Ephesians 2:7).
            </p>
            <p className="lsisti s4s">
              Ephesians 2:8-9 show God’s love at work. The Bible says that our
              works do not provide any help in saving us (Ephesians 2:8). If
              salvation came through works, then we could boast in ourselves
              instead of Jesus (Ephesians 2:9). The Bible says that our
              salvation is given through God’s grace. We receive salvation by
              placing our faith in Jesus. When we place our faith in Jesus, we
              are withdrawing our faith from something else. This is common
              referred to as repentance. When we place our faith in Jesus, we
              are trusting in Him as Savior and Lord. He is the only one who
              could save us, and He is the King of kings.

              When we put our faith in Jesus and receive salvation, we are not
              instantly zapped into heaven. God leaves us on earth because there

            <p className="lsisti s4s">
              We see God’s plan for us in Ephesians 2:10. Through Jesus, we
              belong to God. We are God’s workmanship. We are made new through
              Jesus. The old life is gone, and we now live in our new
              relationship with God (2 Corinthians 5:17). In our new life, we
              live for God’s purpose. His purpose is to love Him and love others
              by making disciples of all nations (Matthew 22:36-40; 28:18-20).{" "}

              If you are saved, you have a testimony. This is a very personal
              way of sharing the Gospel with unbelievers. It allows you to share
              your personal story and the way Jesus has specifically changed
              your life.
            </p>
            <p className="lsisti">
              Write your testimony down on one sheet of paper. Make sure to
              include all three sections:
            </p>
            <p className="lsisti  s4s lss">1. Your Life Before Salvation</p>
            <p className="lsisti  s4s lss">2. How You Got Saved</p>
            <p className="lsisti  s4s lss">3. Your Life with Christ</p>
            <p className="lsisti">
              When writing your testimony, make sure that the Gospel is the main
              focus. Writing your testimony will help you to organize your
              thoughts and better memorize your story. You will want to be able
              to share your testimony in a few different ways. First, see if you
              can share your testimony in 5 minutes. This will allow you to be
              able to naturally share your story within a conversation. Second,
              see if you can share your testimony in 1 minute. Sometimes people
              do not have enough time to get in a conversation, but we can still
              give a shortened version of our story.{" "}
