                Your baptism is very important. It functions as a first step in
                obedience to your Lord and Savior Jesus as well as an
                opportunity to proclaim His name to the world.

            <h2 className="lsist">The Purpose of Baptism</h2>
            <p className="lsisti">
              Believer’s Baptism is an act of obedience to the command of Christ
              and is by full immersion in water after you have been saved
              (Matthew 28:19). Let’s look at baptism in three ways: symbolism,
              proclamation, and obedience.

              Our salvation is a gift provided by Jesus through His death,
              burial, and resurrection (Romans 3:24-26). We received this gift
              through repentance and belief (Mark 1:15). When we trusted in
              Jesus, He brought us from death to life (Romans 2:5). Baptism
              gives physical representation to a spiritual action. During
              baptism, you go under water which represents your sins being
              buried with Jesus. When you come out of the water, you are
              representing the new life that you now have with Jesus (Romans
              6:3-4; Colossians 2:11-12). We are identifying ourselves with
              Jesus’ death, burial, and resurrection through baptism.

            <p className="lsisti s4s">
              In Matthew 3:13-17, we read the story of Jesus’ baptism. Jesus
              asked His cousin, John, to baptize Him. His reason for being
              baptized was to fulfill all righteousness. When Jesus came out of
              the water, the Holy Spirit came down from heaven and rested on
              Him. Then, God the Father proclaimed, “This is my beloved Son,
              with whom I am well pleased” (Matthew 3:17).
            </p>
            <p className="lsisti s4s">
              Jesus was not baptized because He was a sinner in need of
              salvation. For we know He never sinned (1 John 3:5). The purpose
              of His baptism was to proclaim that He is God’s Son, the Savior
              and Lord. We are baptized not as sinners in need of salvation, but
              as those who have been made righteous by Christ and willing to
              proclaim His name.

              Baptism is a symbol of the salvation that we received through
              Jesus and a proclamation that Jesus is who He says He is. It is
              also an act of obedience. In Matthew 28:18-20, Jesus gives a
              command to make discipleship of all nations. He says to baptize
              these disciples in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
              When we trusted Jesus as our Lord and Savior, we surrendered our
              lives to Him that whatever He says we do. As believers, this
              should be one of our first acts of obedience to our King.

            <h2 className="lsist">Practical Aspects of Baptism</h2>
            <p className="lsisti">
              Baptism is an action performed to a believer by another believer
              among other believers. As discussed earlier, baptism is for
              believers as it is a symbol, proclamation and act of obedience. It
              is performed by another believer since Jesus was giving His
              command to make disciples to believers (Matthew 28:18-20).
              Believers’ baptism is performed among other believers as this
              should take place in the context of the church body. Becoming a
              part of a local church is important for your growth with God and
              protection from the deceitful schemes of the world (Ephesians
              4:11-17). When we say church, we are talking about the people not
              the building. The building is just a building, but the believing
              people are the body of Christ.
            </p>
            <p className="lsisti">
              When you get baptized, there will most likely be lost people
              around. So when you give your testimony and walk in obedience to
              God’s command, you are not only demonstrating to the church your
              faith in Christ, but you are proclaiming it to a lost world as
              well. This is a great opportunity to invite the lost to trust in
              Jesus as Lord and Savior.{" "}

            <h2 className="lsist">Things To Do</h2>
            <p className="lsisti">
              If you haven’t already, schedule a time with your pastor to get
              baptized. Invite your family, friends, and coworkers to come. Let
              your pastor know who is coming, so that he can make sure to save
              room for them. Your pastor will want to take the opportunity to
              share the Gospel with your guest on the day of your baptism.
