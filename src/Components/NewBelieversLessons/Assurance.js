            <h2 className="lsist">Temptation</h2>
            <p className="lsisti">
              Before we talk about assurance of salvation, let’s talk about
              temptation. Did you know that after Jesus was baptized (Matthew
              3:13-17) He was tempted by the devil (Matthew 4:1-11)? This
              temptation took place after Jesus had fasted for forty day and
              nights. While Jesus was hungry, the devil came at Him with one
              temptation, “if you are the son of God.” The devil tried this
              trick three times on Jesus. First, the devil wanted Jesus to prove
              His sonship by turning stones into bread. However, Jesus knew only
              the word of God could truly fill His cravings. Second, the devil
              wanted Jesus to prove His sonship by testing God’s faithfulness
              through disobedience. Jesus knew not to disobey and test God.
              Finally, the devil wanted Jesus to worship him in exchange for
              worldly things. Jesus told the devil to leave for He would only
              worship and serve God.
            </p>
            <p className="lsisti">
              The devil will tempt us with the same temptation, “are you truly a
              child of God?” You may have already experienced this temptation
              and will probably experience it again. There will be days that you
              do not feel saved, or you may begin to doubt your salvation. Just
              like Jesus in Matthew 4:1-11, we must hold firm to the word of
              God. This is yet another reason why we need to be studying the
              Bible.

            <h2 className="lsist">Assurance of Salvation</h2>
            <p className="lsisti">
              When we are tempted or doubting our salvation, we need to go to
              trust the word of God over our feelings. There are a few questions
              to ask:
            </p>

                What does the Bible say about receiving salvation?
              </h3>
            </div>
            <p className="lsisti s4s">
              As discussed in the Gospel lesson, we are saved when we first hear
              the Gospel and then respond to the Gospel. The Gospel is the good
              news that Jesus died on the cross, was buried, and rose from the
              grave after three days (1 Corinthians 15:3-4). He did this so that
              our sins could be forgive and we could have a forever relationship
              with God (Romans 4:25).
            </p>
            <p className="lsisti s4s">
              We respond to the Gospel by repenting of our sins, believing in
              Jesus as Savior, and confessing Jesus as Lord (Mark 1:15; Romans
              10:9-10). When we repent, we are turning away or withdrawing our
              faith from what is not Jesus. We then turn and place our faith in
              Jesus that He died and rose on the third day. Since we are
              surrendering our lives to Him, we confess Him as Lord. He has full
              authority over us.
            </p>
            <p className="lsisti s4s">
              These are the biblical instruction for how salvation was offered
              to us and how we are to respond to the good news. If you have done
              as the Bible says and placed your faith in Jesus, then you are
              saved. This is truth.{" "}
            </p>
            <p className="lsisti s4s">
              Receiving salvation relies on the truth of God’s word. So, when
              you are tempted to think that you are not saved, go back to God’s
              word and ask: 1. Did I place my faith in Jesus as Savior like the
              Bible says? 2. Did I confess Jesus as Lord like the Bible says? If
              the answer is yes, then be assured that you are saved according to
              God’s word. There is no other way to be saved. Remember Ephesians
              2:8-9? You are not saved by your own doing. Salvation is God’s
              gift. Your deeds do not save you, and you cannot boast in anything
              but God.
            </p>

                What does the Bible say about keeping salvation?

            </div>
            <p className="lsisti s4s">
              The second part of assurance is the topic of
              salvation-maintenance. In other words, can I lose my salvation?
              When you trusted in Jesus, He begin to work in and through you
              (Ephesians 2:10; 4:23-24). These works are evident to those around
              you in your local Church body. The temptation will be to think
              that these works maintain your salvation. However, these works are
              fruit of your salvation.
            </p>
            <p className="lsisti s4s">
              In John 10:27-30, Jesus gave very comforting words for everyone
              who placed their faith in Him. His followers listen, know, and
              follow Him. They have forever life and will never perish. Then, he
              says, “…no one will snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has
              given them to me, is greater than all, and no one is able to
              snatch them out of the Father’s hand. I and the Father are one”
              (John 10:28-30). Jesus maintains our salvation, not us. We have
              assurance because of who Jesus is.
            </p>
            <p className="lsisti s4s">
              When talking to believers, the apostle Paul ask, “Who shall
              separate us from the love of Christ” (Romans 8:35)? Can anyone or
              anything be more powerful than God to take us away from the
              forever relationship we have with Him? No! If a forever
              relationship could end, then it would not be a “forever”
              relationship. Paul gives a list of things that cannot take away
              our salvation: tribulation, distress, persecution, famine,
              nakedness, danger, sword, death, life, angels, rulers, things
              present, things to come, powers, height, depth, nor anything else
              in all creation (Romans 8:35-39). Salvation is given by Jesus and
              maintained by Jesus. You received it and now walk in it.
